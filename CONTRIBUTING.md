# Contributing to Techroad

A big welcome and thank you for considering contributing to Techroad! Itâ€™s people like you that make it a reality for users in our community.

Reading and following these guidelines will help us make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.
It also communicates that you agree to respect the time of the developers managing and developing these open source projects.
In return, we will reciprocate that respect by addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Code of Conduct

We take our open source community seriously and hold ourselves and other contributors to high standards of communication.
By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ryancho/techroad-community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- To report security vulnerabilities, please contacting the project team at lion.cho@techroad.io.
- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in a timely manner but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw attention if your issue is blocking.
- If you've never contributed before, see [the first timer's guide on our blog](https://auth0.com/blog/a-first-timers-guide-to-an-open-source-project/) for resources and tips on how to get started.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the library, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created.
When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one.

### Pull Requests

PRs to our libraries are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.



## <a name="rules"></a> Coding Rules
To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

* All features or bug fixes **must be tested** by one or more specs (unit-tests).
* All public API methods **must be documented**. (Details TBC).
* We follow [Google's Typescript Style Guide](https://github.com/google/gts), but wrap all code at
  **100 characters**. An automated formatter is available, see
  [DEVELOPER.md](docs/DEVELOPER.md#clang-format).

## <a name="commit"></a> Commit Message Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.  This leads to **more
readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**.  But also,
we use the git commit messages to **generate the Angular change log**.

### Commit Message Format
Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer than 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier
to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

The footer should contain a [closing reference to an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) if any.

Samples: (even more [samples](https://github.com/angular/angular/commits/master))

```
docs(changelog): update changelog to beta.5
```
```
fix(release): need to depend on the latest rxjs and zone.js

The version in our package.json gets copied to the one we publish, and users need the latest of these.
```

### Revert
If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body, it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

### Type
Must be one of the following:

* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
* **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

### Scope
The scope should be the name of the npm package affected (as perceived by the person reading the changelog generated from commit messages).

The following is the list of supported scopes:

* **animations**
* **bazel**
* **benchpress**
* **common**
* **compiler**
* **compiler-cli**
* **core**
* **elements**
* **forms**
* **http**
* **language-service**
* **localize**
* **platform-browser**
* **platform-browser-dynamic**
* **platform-server**
* **platform-webworker**
* **platform-webworker-dynamic**
* **router**
* **service-worker**
* **upgrade**
* **zone.js**

There are currently a few exceptions to the "use package name" rule:

* **packaging**: used for changes that change the npm package layout in all of our packages, e.g.
  public path changes, package.json changes done to all packages, d.ts file/format changes, changes
  to bundles, etc.
* **changelog**: used for updating the release notes in CHANGELOG.md
* **docs-infra**: used for docs-app (angular.io) related changes within the /aio directory of the
  repo
* **dev-infra**: used for dev-infra related changes within the directories /scripts, /tools and /dev-infra
* **migrations**: used for changes to the `ng update` migrations.
* **ngcc**: used for changes to the [Angular Compatibility Compiler](./packages/compiler-cli/ngcc/README.md)
* **ve**: used for changes specific to ViewEngine (legacy compiler/renderer).
* none/empty string: useful for `style`, `test` and `refactor` changes that are done across all
  packages (e.g. `style: add missing semicolons`) and for docs changes that are not related to a
  specific package (e.g. `docs: fix typo in tutorial`).

### Subject
The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize the first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

### Body
Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer
The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

A detailed explanation can be found in this [document][commit-message-format].
